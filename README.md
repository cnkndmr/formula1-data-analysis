## Table of Contents:

1. [Position by lap chart](src/01-position_by_lap.ipynb)

- [ ] Add pretty tables
- [ ] Pit stops to be added to table
- [ ] Convert all time to milliseconds, making calculations on normal datetime is unnecessarily hard
- [ ] Instead of using script for downloading data, use zip file on database website

NOTES:
Charts and graphs look pretty
